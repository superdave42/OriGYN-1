3D DIGITIZING PROBE FOR CNC MACHINE TO FIND THE ORIGIN OF XYZ. PIEZO SENSOR

My name is David Cook and I have created a very simple Piezo disc touch sensor for a CNC machine to be able to find the Origin of XYZ. This is intended as a fun and rewarding project that teaches mechanical design,sensors,electronics,micro controller, embeded programing.

Using a 20mm piezo disc, small 3mm Renishaw ruby sphere stylus, 3d printed SLA housing, Arduino Nano, NPN resistor, 1M ohm resistor, 5.1v Zener diode.

The arduino code has an output pin that can be used to drive LED indicator or 5V buzzer or....... www.dc-concepts.com
